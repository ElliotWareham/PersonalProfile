      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am currently a call handler working with the NHS to provide support, forensic evidence gathering and medical examinations for victims of sexual assault. I am learning web development and am due to study Computer Science in order to have a career in the tech industry. I ❤️ coding, climbing, camping and cooking.</p>

          <h3>Climbing</h3>
          <p>I have been climbing for about a year. I predominantly do bouldering. I try to go 2 to 3 times a week. I find it is a good way to unwind and great for my fitness. I really enjoy a challenge, which is why I like the sport so much as it challenges me both physically and mentally.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I have been learning coding for close to 2 years now. I love learning about it and all of its capabilities. I initially got into it with the view to start a career, however once I realised how much I enjoy it, I realised it could be more than a job and it is now a hobby. I am self-taught, however I will be starting a Computer Science course at College soon to expand my knowledge.</p>
